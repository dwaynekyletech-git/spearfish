# SpearfishIn AI - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

SpearfishIn AI is a career acceleration platform that revolutionizes the job application process for developers by enabling them to build targeted solutions for companies rather than sending traditional resumes. The platform leverages AI to help developers research companies, identify pain points, generate project ideas, build solutions, and craft personalized outreach campaigns.

**Problem:** The traditional job application process is broken. Developers face:
- High volume competition (500+ applicants per role)
- Low response rates from cold applications
- AI automation replacing entry-level positions
- Difficulty standing out in crowded applicant pools

**Solution:** SpearfishIn AI implements "The Spearfishing Method" - a strategic approach where developers:
1. Discover companies aligned with their skills and interests
2. Research company pain points and technical landscape
3. Build targeted solutions addressing specific problems
4. Execute personalized outreach demonstrating value upfront

**Target Users:** Junior to mid-level developers seeking to:
- Stand out in competitive job markets
- Demonstrate skills through practical projects
- Build a portfolio of targeted solutions
- Secure interviews through value-first approaches

**Value Proposition:** Replace passive resume submissions with proactive value demonstration, dramatically increasing interview conversion rates by showcasing problem-solving abilities before the first conversation.

  - Willingness to deprecate unused features
  - Focus on job-to-be-done, not feature list

**Risk: Single Developer Bottleneck**
- **Impact:** Slow development, no redundancy
- **Likelihood:** High if solo founder
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use no-code/low-code tools where possible
  - Leverage pre-built components (shadcn-ui)
  - Focus on core differentiators, not infrastructure
  - Build modular, maintainable code for future team
  - Document decisions and architecture
  - Consider technical co-founder or contractor

### MVP Scoping Strategy

**Minimum Viable Product Definition:**

The MVP must enable users to:
1. Sign up and create a profile (5 min)
2. Discover 3-5 relevant companies (10 min)
3. Research 1 company deeply (5 min)
4. Get 3-5 project ideas for that company (2 min)
5. Add 1 project to their portfolio (3 min)
6. Generate 1 personalized outreach email (2 min)

**Total time to value: ~30 minutes**

**What's In MVP:**
- ✅ Authentication (Clerk with email/password and social OAuth)
- ✅ Onboarding (simplified to 3 steps)
- ✅ Company discovery (10 companies, basic filters)
- ✅ Company research (Voltagent Deep Research Agent)
- ✅ Project idea generation (Voltagent Project Generator Agent)
- ✅ Portfolio (list view, basic CRUD)
- ✅ Email generation (Voltagent Email Outreach Agent)
- ✅ Dashboard (navigation hub only)

**What's Out of MVP:**
- ❌ OAuth providers
- ❌ Advanced search and filtering
- ❌ Rich text editing
- ❌ Image uploads
- ❌ Public portfolios
- ❌ Social features
- ❌ Analytics and tracking
- ❌ Notification system
- ❌ Mobile app
- ❌ Browser extension
- ❌ Team features
- ❌ Premium tier

**Success Metrics for MVP:**
- 100 signups in first month
- 40% complete onboarding
- 20% complete one full cycle (onboarding → email sent)
- 10% report positive response to outreach
- User session time > 15 minutes
- NPS > 30

**MVP Validation Goals:**
1. Confirm users will complete onboarding
2. Verify AI-generated research is useful
3. Validate project ideas are actionable
4. Test if emails get responses
5. Understand which features users want next
6. Identify major usability issues

## Appendix

### Research Findings

**Job Search Statistics:**
- Average developer role receives 500+ applications
- Cold email response rate: 1-3%
- Response rate with personalized demo: 15-25% (estimated)
- Time to hire: 4-8 weeks for experienced developers
- 70% of jobs filled through networking, not applications

**Developer Pain Points:**
- "My resume never gets past ATS systems"
- "I can't stand out among hundreds of applicants"
- "I have the skills but can't prove them"
- "I don't know how to network effectively"
- "Building projects in isolation doesn't help job search"

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Traditional job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn): High volume, low signal
- Portfolio platforms (GitHub, personal sites): Passive, not targeted
- Networking platforms (LinkedIn): Requires existing connections
- Project-based learning (freeCodeCamp): Not connected to job search
- **Gap:** No tool connects research → projects → outreach in one flow

### Technical Specifications

**Performance Targets:**
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.5s
- Lighthouse Score: > 90
- API Response Time (non-AI): < 200ms
- AI Generation Time: < 30s (with streaming feedback)

**Browser Support:**
- Chrome/Edge: Last 2 versions
- Firefox: Last 2 versions
- Safari: Last 2 versions
- Mobile Safari: iOS 14+
- Mobile Chrome: Android 10+

**Accessibility Standards:**
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation for all features
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast ratios > 4.5:1
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements

**Security Requirements:**
- HTTPS only with security headers
- Clerk JWT token management (automatic expiration and refresh)
- Clerk password requirements and security policies
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/hour for Voltagent agent endpoints
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries and Supabase RLS
- XSS protection via input sanitization
- CSRF protection via Clerk session validation
- Webhook signature verification for Clerk events

**Data Retention:**
- User profiles: Indefinite (until account deletion)
- Generated research: 90 days
- Project ideas: Until user deletes
- Outreach emails: 1 year
- Session logs: 30 days
- Error logs: 90 days

### Glossary
